### How PetPlace App works

**Meet your best friend in 3 simple steps!**

Step 1: Tell us what you wish for
\*Tell us what kind of pet (species and breed) you would love to have using our app. One of our operators will get in touch with you by video call to make the first visual ecounter with your pet.

Step 2: Confirm and order
\*We will get your pet to your door as quick as a wink. Just tell us where and when we can find you. You can order food and toys for the little one that we can also deliver for free to your house.

Step 3: Choose your plan
\*Optionally, you can choose one of our plans to keep your pet well-fed and cared. Every start of the week we will deliver premium food for your pet at lower cost than usual! In addition, with our premium plan, we will bring one toy every start of the month and all of these with no delivery cost!

Very professional! They will video-call you and show the animal you described that you wish before bringing it safely to your door! (Beatrice O'Neil)
The food delivery program is very convenient! I don't have to worry no more about buying food for my cat on my way home! (Karina Simson)
